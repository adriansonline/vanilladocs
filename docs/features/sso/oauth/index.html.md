## SSO with OAuth: Overview

Because OAuth 2.0 is an SSO *framework* and not a narrowly defined protocol, custom services work is typically required to set up an OAuth solution for your forum.

Vanilla currently provides OAuth2 integrations with these third-party services as ready-to-go addons:

* Facebook
* Twitter
* LinkedIn
* Google+

Contact the Vanilla Support Team for more information.
