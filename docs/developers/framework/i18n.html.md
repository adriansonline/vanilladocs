## Adding translatable phrases to Vanilla

Considerations for adding phrases to Vanilla or your addon:

* Default to English.
* Use the `t()` for all user-viewed text.
* Never use `t()` for HTML classes or other frontend code.
* Always use a succinct definition string.
* Avoid jargon or regional dialect.
