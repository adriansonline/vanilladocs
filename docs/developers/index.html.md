## Developers Overview

The Developers section is primarily targeted at folks using the **open source product** who have at least a basic understanding of PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Clients of VanillaForums.com (cloud) should [contact support](http://vanillaforums.com/help) to address technical issues. Our hosted product does not allow direct file access to ensure security and performance, which precludes many instructions in this section.

## Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure

Found a security issue? Please contact us at support@vanillaforums.com. This allows us to release a patch as quickly as possible and, hopefully, before knowledge of it becomes widespread. For all other issues, please use the [GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/vanillaforums/vanilla).

We do not currently offer a bug bounty program. We count on the support of the tens of thousands of folks running our software freely around the world to help us improve the product for the benefit of everyone.
