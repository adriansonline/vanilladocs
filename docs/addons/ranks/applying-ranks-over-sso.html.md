## Applying Ranks over SSO

Create a new rank or edit an existing one, checking "Applied Manually".

You can now edit a user's profile and select that Rank or apply it over SSO by adding a matching RankID or Rank_Name parameter to the callback.

This only works if you have checked "Applied Manually" on the rank. Also make sure that no automatically-triggered Ranks have a higher level, or they will override when triggered.
